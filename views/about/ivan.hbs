      <p class="card-text my-4">I worked as a mechanic for 15 years, the last 4 on electric vehicle development, as part of the developer's team. <br>
        During that work, I has my first contact with programming and I start being interested in this world. <br>
        Later a workmate does the Ironhack's BootCamp and talks me a lot about the experience, and this was the last push 
        to do the BootCamp this year. <br>
        And I'm very proud of this decision.

        <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align: center;">Scuba Diver</h5>
      <p class="card-text my-4">Ironhack's first module final project. <br>
      Videogame made with HTML5 canvas, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
      This videogame is about a scuba diver (one of my passions), and the diver will take pictures of sea life but takes care with no collision with some of the objects can quit life him.

      <p class="card-text my-4">My first proyect ever. <br>
      Made all with only HTML5 and CSS. <br>
      I made this project when I end the pre-work of Ironhack, and I have only a bit of knowledge of the web development world. <br>
      Don't judge hard this project, please ;)
